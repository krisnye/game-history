# Game History - Learning Template

A minimal starter template for teaching junior developers game programming. This repository contains a simple Pong game implemented in a single HTML file.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to the local server URL (typically `http://localhost:5173/pong.html`)

## What's Included

- **Minimal Vite setup** - Fast development server with hot reload
- **Single-file Pong game** - All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file (`src/pong.html`)
- **No build complexity** - Perfect for beginners to understand the basics

## How to Play

- Use **W/S** keys or **Arrow Up/Down** to move your paddle
- Press **SPACE** to start the game
- Score points by getting the ball past the computer's paddle

## Learning Goals

This template is designed to teach:
- Basic game loop concepts
- Canvas drawing and animation
- User input handling
- Collision detection
- Simple AI (computer opponent)
- Game state management

## For Instructors

The single-file approach makes it easy for students to:
- See all the code in one place
- Understand the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Make changes and see immediate results
- Gradually learn more complex concepts

Feel free to use this as a starting point for more advanced game projects!
